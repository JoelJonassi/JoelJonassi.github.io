## Overview

The Support System for Lawyers is a web platform created as part of a collaborative project, aimed at streamlining legal case management. The platform automates critical legal tasks and helps lawyers comply with strict government deadlines. By integrating advanced features like case management, document tracking, and deadline monitoring, this system minimizes human error and optimizes the efficiency of legal operations.

## Project Versions

The project was developed in two versions:
