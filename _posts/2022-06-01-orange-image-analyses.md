## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of a **Computer Vision** course assignment, aimed to design an **Orange Recognition System** for automating tasks in a citrus fruit production line. The system focused on:

- Counting the total number of oranges
- Calculating the area and perimeter of each orange
- Identifying the location (bounding box) and center of gravity
- Measuring orange size based on caliber standards (Quality Standards for Citrus Fruits)
- Classifying oranges by quality (Commission Regulation EEC 379/71)

### Key Details
- **Language**: C++
- **Focus**: Implementing algorithms manually for image processing without using pre-built libraries
- **Purpose**: To enhance understanding of fundamental computer vision techniques and their industrial applications

## Features
- Accurate orange identification in complex scenes with other fruits
- Quality assessment and categorization based on international citrus fruit standards
- Automated measurements improving efficiency and reducing human error in production lines
