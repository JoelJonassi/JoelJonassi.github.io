            For my bachelor thesis I developed a mobile application, a RESTFul API and a web platform based on a POC for monitoring animals in mountain areas, enabling tracking and understanding of animal behaviour in mountain areas.This is a system that includes (Web platform, Mobile application, Restful API).

            This project was developed during the internship at Optimezer, a company that provides consulting services in the it sector, the internship was conducted in the area of IoT and integration architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            From February to June 2023 I worked on the development of the RESTFul API using C#, PostgreSQL to store data and Mosquitto to communicate with the IoT devices. The mobile aplication was developed using Kotlin and the Web platform using Angular.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the internship I worked on Technical documentation about how to use the API and the mobile application, and I also worked on the development of a web platform to support the mobile application.
