  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    For my bachelor thesis, I developed a complete system comprising a mobile application, a RESTful API, and a web platform. The project, a proof of concept (POC), was aimed at monitoring animals in mountain regions to better understand their behaviors.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system was built during my internship at <b>Optmizer</b>, a company specializing in IT consulting, where I worked within the IoT and integration architecture domain.
  </p>

  <h3>Development Timeline</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>February - June 2023:</b> Developed the RESTful API using C# and PostgreSQL, integrating Mosquitto for IoT communication.</li>
    <li>Created a Kotlin-based mobile application for on-the-go monitoring.</li>
    <li>Designed a web platform using Angular to support and visualize mobile application data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Technical Contributions</h3>
  <p>
    I also prepared detailed documentation, including technical guides for the API and user manuals for the mobile application. This effort ensured usability and maintainability for all developed solutions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the developed code cannot be shared due to project confidentiality and NDA commitments. However, written materials in Portuguese are available for exploration.
