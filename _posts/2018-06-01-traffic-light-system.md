### **About the Project**

This project was developed in 2018 as part of the **Professional Aptitude Test** for the **Electronics, Automation, and Control Technician course** at **Cior Professional School**. The aim was to create an engaging, educational tool to teach children the importance of traffic rules and promote good citizenship on the roads. The project was implemented at the **Road Education School in Ribeirão**.

I contributed to this initiative by designing and implementing a **Traffic Light System** using **Arduino** and embedded systems. The system controlled traffic signals, creating a realistic and interactive experience tailored to children’s perspectives. Additionally, I participated in the **installation of the system's infrastructure**, which involved electrical work to ensure proper setup and functionality.
