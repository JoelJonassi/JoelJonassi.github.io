School Project
Developed and implemented an intelligent agent to optimize class schedules by minimizing travel
to campus and classroom utilization. The agent aimed to find the most efficient solution that
reduced the number of days each class had to commute and minimized the overall need forclassrooms, thereby contributing to a reduction in campus travel and the requirement for air
conditioning.
SKILLS: Python, Jupyter, Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), GIT and GitHub.
