            <li><strong>Category</strong>: APP</li>

        </ul>
        This project was developed as an educational initiative to learn application design in C using Glade and GTK+. I created user interfaces (UIs) for C programs and packaged them for easy installation. The project involved developing practical applications like a calculator and a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) page for user management. These applications were designed to master UI development and integration with C applications.<br>

        Additionally, I prepared the applications for distribution and created installers using Inno Setup, ensuring they could be easily installed on various platforms.<br>

        Feel free to explore the project's GitHub repository for more details and to see the code: GitHub Repository.
