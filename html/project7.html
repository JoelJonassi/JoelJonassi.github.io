            This project was developed as a learn design app in C using Glade ang GTK+.

            Project developed within the scope of the Applied Project discipline, to make classrooms more sustainable.
    
            During the academic journey, a regular situation among newly arrived students is to seek information at the reception such as: i) Where the classes of a particular curricular unit are taking place ii) Where a particular room is located, and in certain situations the receptionist has to accompany the place iii) Collect information from the room, which teacher is teaching? what discipline? what is the state of the room (temperature, humidity, harmful gases) iv) Turn off equipment eg. "Air conditioning" often forgotten on, turn off the lights. It is in this context that the SmartRooms project emerged, combined with the concept of Smart Cities to improve the life of the academic in everyday life, it is a bidirectional system, which allows to control actuators and receive the status of actuators eg. "temperature, humidity, etc." through a mobile application.Project developed within the scope of the Applied Project discipline, to make classrooms more sustainable.
