              This project was developed as a school assignment for a computer vision subject.
              <br>
              The main objective was to develop an algorithm capable of performing the following tasks on a production
              line of oranges:
            <ul>
              <li>Counting the total number of oranges.</li>
              <li>Calculating the area and perimeter of each orange.</li>
              <li>Determining the location (bounding box) and center of gravity of each orange.</li>
              <li>Measuring the orange size (Quality Standards for Citrus Fruits, Calibre).</li>
              <li>Classifying each orange based on quality standards (Quality Standards for Citrus Fruits, Quality
                Feature, Classification).</li>
            </ul>
            The project was implemented in C, emphasizing manual algorithm development for image manipulation instead of
            relying on existing libraries.
            <br>
            It was part of a university project in the field of Computer Vision, aimed at understanding and implementing
            fundamental image processing algorithms.
