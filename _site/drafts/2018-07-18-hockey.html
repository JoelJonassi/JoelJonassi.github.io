<p>I always wanted to try ice hockey just for fun, to see what it was like. If I didn’t do it my last year of high school, when else would I be able to? It’s another check mark on my bucket list.</p>

<p>It has been four years since I first stepped onto the ice in shoulder pads, hockey pants, shin guards that were slightly too large and a jersey that was way too small. My first on-ice practice, I remember the intimidating warm-up drills that were going on while I could barely do crossovers due to the pads and the fact that I had no rocker, no toe pick, and a too shallow hollow on my blade. Nowadays, I step onto the ice in all that gear with a stick and a puck, I still feel oddly out of place. I can skate. I can’t skate with a puck. On the inside, I still freak out a bit whenever I hear the deafening crack of a slap shot crashing into the towering plexiglass boards of the ice rink.</p>

<p>But I am having so much fun.</p>

<p>In mid-November, my high school hockey team entered a tournament with the expectation of losing every game; we perceived it as a tool to allow weaker, less experienced players (like me) to gain some valuable ice time and game situation practice. Our main varsity goalie as well as our entire first line had other priorities and could not skate in the tournament. The first game against Oakdale was a shutout: 9–0, loss.</p>

<p>Only a few hours later, the unexpected occurred. Though everyone was visibly exhausted, we put up a great fight against La Plata, winning 4–2. I had also gotten my first two penalties. Because my clear weakness is stick handling a puck, I decided to use my skating skills and check as many people as I could. Checking is the highlight of my entire hockey “career”. That night, I could not fall asleep because the game’s adrenaline had not worn off yet, because I could not wait for the next game so I could wreck even more people on the ice.</p>

    Right after our first win against La Plata!
</div>

<p>“Don’t fall” is the number one rule in figure skating due to it’s major deductions from grade-of-execution scores, program component scores, and above all, the total score. But in hockey, who cares? Nobody, as long the puck stays out of one’s own goal and ends up in the opponent’s. It’s thrilling to skate without worrying about quality of skating, appearance, and so on. While I love figure skating, and I would never give it up, hockey is a nice break.</p>

<p>My high school team was also incredible, both on the ice and off. It never ceases to amaze me how some can just soar across the ice while moving the puck (which always seems to get lost whenever I try), or hit a puck and make it fly beautifully into the net. Not to brag, but one of the guys on the team is also apparently one of the best in Maryland.</p>

<p>For the very first dry land practice during the summer, where I met most of the team for the first time, I was absolutely terrified. The term “hockey player” was depicted as large, rude, scary in my head; I also dreaded the potential awkwardness of talking to people to whom I haven’t spoken since middle school.</p>

<p>Two or three months into the season, after sharing the ice and the locker room, enjoying one team lunch, and playing Thanksgiving flag football, everyone has turned out to be supportive, fun, adorable at times, and lovable. Not only did I have people waving at me or giving me high-fives in the hallway, I got two elegantly crafted baked goods the Friday of any home game. The locker room conversations also never cease to amaze or entertain me.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I play for the MIT Men’s Club Ice Hockey Team. Despite a rocky relationship with a few members of the team this season, the past two seasons have been especially rewarding. I have found some of my best friends on the team. I’ve grown as a skater, as a hockey player, and as a teammate from my dabbling in hockey, and it’s made me appreciate the skills of a foreign sport.</p>

<div class="graphic-caption">
    That's also me!
</div>

<p>So what’s more difficult- figure skating or ice hockey? To be honest, I have no idea. Both require skills that take hours of dedication per day on the ice and in the gym to develop skills at a competitive level. Both suffer physical injury and emotional distress. Both demand athleticism, balance, and stamina.</p>

<p>Hockey has trained me to perceive my environment and respond accordingly without hesitation in any given scenario, which I call dynamic thinking. The teamwork necessary to perform under such circumstances is incredible as well: I have to be able to predict and cooperate and support. In synchronized skating, the teamwork is completely different; it is not built on responses and quick alterations, but rather memorization and line-up in synchronicity, such that each skater contributes towards the overall picture of speed and shape woven with grace and elegance and beauty.</p>

<p>My only regret is not starting hockey earlier.</p>
